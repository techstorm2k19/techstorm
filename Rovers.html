						<p class='dummy-text'><b>Event Description :</b> Two bots will start from two opposite sides of arena. There will be an inclined plane & a combat zone. Points will be provided in both zones. There will be some changes in the arena from preliminary round to final round. In preliminary rounds there will be a cuboidal arena with two inclined planes. At the entrance there will be a flap gate and an inclined plane through which bots will enter. Two cuboidal ditches will be present inside the arena at possible edges.

# All the rounds will be solo with increasing arena complexities (can be box number or hurdels) towards the finals.<br/>

# Time taken by the robots to complete the track will be the only criteria of judgement for qualification to the next round.<br/>

# There will be total 2min of technical help for every team which can be taken atmost 2 divition (eg: 1 min 30 sec + 30 sec or 1 min + 1 min) <br/>

# Under any circumtances , after the beginning of the round team participants must not touch the bots except in the technical timeout.<br/>

# Teams who chose to quit (for tecnical fault) will not be considered while shortlisting candidates for the next round in any case.<br/>

# Stepping on the track is forbidden. This can only be done by co-ordinators. Failing to abide will lead to disqualification without any refunds.<br/>

# Participants will be provided with a standard 220-volts 50 Hz AC power supply outlet.<br/>

# The robot should fit in a box of dimension 40cm (l) x 30cm (b) x 30cm (h) with the picking
mechanisms. <br/>

# No two team should share the same robot.<br/>

# Maximum weight of robot should not be more than 4 kgs. External control device shall not be considered for weight and size measurement.<br/>

# The robot may be wired or wireless. There is a Special credit for wireless bot. But for wireless, it is
mandatory to use dual frequency remote or else it will lead to disqualification. For wired bots, the
length must be enough for cover the entire arena.<br/>

# Lego kit or spare parts are strictly prohibited. However team can use readymade gear system.<br/>

# The potential difference between any two points should not exceed 24 V DC at any point of time
during the run round is an aptitude round with tricky questions, out of which 4 teams proceed to the finals.<br/>

						<p class='dummy-text'><b>Event Description :</b>  Today the advanced science and technology have made
great changes to people&#39;s life. Mechatronics being one of them. In
mechatronics, the movement of robotic arms or legs for completion of a
particular task is done by automatic control logic i.e. the motors connected to
these limbs are controlled by programming a microcontroller. Talking of
microcontroller, Arduino can be one good example to start with. Arduino has
launched a global contest that challenges users of its open-source electronics
platform to create innovative products that help advance the development of
Industry 4.0 automation and robotics applications.
In this competition you have to blink led panels and also perform other tasks
like controlling a motor by programming an Arduino in a fixed amount of time.</p>
