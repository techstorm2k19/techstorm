							Event Description : 
							</u><br><br>
							Techniq is an event that combines mental ability with knowledge and craftsmanship. The first
round is an aptitude round with tricky questions, out of which 4 teams proceed to the finals.</p>
						<p class="dummy-text">
							<u>Rules & Regulation :</u>
							<br><br>
							<b>1.PHARAOH:</b> The Pharaoh is the most important piece for each side. If hit with a laser, it is destroyed and its owner loses the game. Similar to a king in chess, the Pharaoh pieces are comparatively weak, and so are often not moved unless under duress.
<br>
<b>2.SCARABS:</b> Scarabs consist primarily of large, dual-sided mirrors. They reflect a laser coming in from any direction, and thus cannot be eliminated from the board. Also, unlike other pieces, Scarabs may move into an adjacent square even if it is already occupied, by switching places with the piece found there (whichever color it may be). Thus, they are the most powerful pieces on the board, but must be used with care, as a move that puts one side of the mirror in a favorable position may expose the player to attack using the opposite side of the same mirror.
<br>
<b>3.SPHINXES:</b> In Khet 2.0, the Sphinxes hold the lasers. They may not move (each player's is located at their closest right-hand corner) but may be rotated in place so as to fire down the rank instead of the file. A Sphinx is unaffected by laser fire, whether the opponent's or its own reflected back upon itself.
<br>
							<b>4.ANUBES:</b> Anubis has the advantage that, despite still being unmirrored, they are not affected by a laser strike on the front; they must be hit on the sides or rear in order to be eliminated.
<br>
							<b>5.PYRAMIDS:</b> Pyramids have a single diagonal mirror, and form the primary mechanism for directing the path of the laser. They are vulnerable to a hit from two of the four sides, and must be defended lest the player lose their ability to build paths of any size.
<br><br>
							<u>General Guidelines</u>
							<br><br>
1.Two players will play in one set at a time. (3 sets are available)
<br>
2.In each turn a player will get a maximum of two minutes and for the next minute a negative point will be added. Maximum time limit is 3 minutes.
<br>
3.If he/she does not make any move within the stipulated time, then and there he/she will be eliminated and opponent shall be declared as winner.
<br>
4.A maximum of three warnings will be given for breaking any rule with a negative point.
<br>
5.Negative points will be the measure for breaking tie-ups, if any.
<br>
6.Mirrors of the pieces must not be touched.
